# Community engagement braindump
**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS** 

__Please get in touch with us with your suggestions!__

* get some community support from other modelers
    * mechanistic modeling in particular can be lonely/solo
    * some of us had few/no cohort
    * interdisciplinary woes
    * learning how to communicate/present/write for a variety of fields
    * time management
    * other issues associated with (math, coding, biology, statistics, etc)
* find collaborators
    * maybe easier to complete a project by finding modelers with certain skills
        * especially if you are working for an experimentalist???? (opinions pls)
* help everyone keep up with literature, modeling events, etc by promoting thru social media avenues you already visit
* cross promote tools, blogs, etc so less 'reinventing the wheel'
    * maybe can be helpful if you TA
    * find replacements for ancient tools that aren't kept up well 
    * find new tools/code to make your job easier
    * Exposure to new concepts that might be useful in their research?
        * new approaches (eg, machine learning, bayesian parameter estimation, low-data parameter estimation techniques, sensitivity analysis ) --> and get feedback/assistance/advice from modelers who already use them 
* help undergrad, grad modelers get to the next stage 
    * maybe a few problems that are relatively unique?
* get help with coding or math for your own projects
    * between-modeler mentorship 
        * Coding ex: python, R, matlab, latex, github, shell scripting (bioinfo), linux/ubuntu 
        * Concept ex: version control, good coding practices, documentation, parameter estimation, websites, data cleaning and storage
    * help with navigating complex tools/concepts 
* Literature repository
    * Annotated resource (bibtex file?) that is easily searchable?
        * searching might be a technical issue that we can figure out eventually
* create community resources
    * access to domain-specific data
    * up to date model repository
    * shareable analysis/code/pipeline
    * focus on reproducible analysis
    * List of blogs of other modelers/scientists that are worth following
* misc
    * complain anonymously
    * create private chats/forums
